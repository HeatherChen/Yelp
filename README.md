CS224W final project

Stats:
- category distribution + how many categories in total
- Business score distribution, ex. business avg score (total/ per category)
- User avg star distribution
- User review count distribution
- Business review count distribution
- review votes vs. difference between true score and the review score (three lines for funny, useful, cool)
- business score vs. review count correlation (x_axis: score, y_axis: review count box plot) (goal: want to know 
  if a business having more reviews also has a higher score)
